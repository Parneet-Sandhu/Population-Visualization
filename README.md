# Global Population Distribution Visualizations

This repository contains visualizations of global population data sourced from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL). The data spans from 1960 to 2023 and provides insights into population growth trends, country comparisons, and other key aspects of demographic changes.

## Overview

The notebook `population_distribution.ipynb` analyzes and visualizes population data from the World Bank, focusing on:

- Global population growth from 1960 to 2023.
- Country-specific population trends.
- Yearly population changes and comparisons across regions.

## Data Source
